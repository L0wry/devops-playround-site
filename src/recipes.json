    "description": "Zesty Chicken. Halved chicken is a perfect choice for winter grilling. Cooked over indirect heat, it virtually eliminates grill flare-ups. This version from Micheal Everidge of Morristown, Tennessee features a tangy four-ingredient mustard sauce you can whip up in minutes. Zesty Chicken Recipe photo by Taste of Home.",
    "method": "In a small bowl, combine the mustard, honey, seasoning blend and Worcestershire sauce. Carefully loosen the skin of the chicken; spoon some of the mustard mixture under the skin. Using long-handled tongs, moisten a paper towel with cooking oil and lightly coat the grill rack. Prepare grill for indirect heat, using a drip pan. Place chicken skin side up over drip pan and grill, covered, over indirect medium heat for 20-30 minutes on each side or until juices run clear and a thermometer reads 180°, basting occasionally with remaining mustard mixture. Cover chicken and let stand for 5 minutes before cutting into serving-size pieces."

    "description": "Everyone loves a good Asian noodle salad, right? How do you like yours? I like mine with lots of colorful veggies tossed in with the noodles, so it feels more like a “salad” and not just highly seasoned cold noodles. Nothing wrong with plain noodles, mind you! In fact, the beauty of this salad is its flexibility. Add as many or as few extras as you want. I love the colors and crunch of purple cabbage and red bell peppers so they’re in, along with carrots and steamed broccoli.",
    "method": "Bring 4 quarts of water to a rolling boil in a large pot. If using Chinese noodles, do not add salt (they are already salted). If using soba or pasta noodles, add a tablespoon of salt to the water. Add the noodles to the pot. Stir the noodles frequently while they cook. Check the noodle package instructions, if using Chinese noodles, they should be done after 5 minutes of cooking. Drain the noodles, rinse with cold water to stop the cooking. Spread the noodles out on a sheet pan to air dry."

    "description": "Quinoa, a new ingredient that has been around for thousands of years, is a tiny, high-protein grain from South America. It's nicknamed the 'wonder grain' because it cooks more quickly than rice, is virtually foolproof, and is lighter and more nutritious than other grains.",
    "method": "Bring the water to a boil in a large saucepan. Add the quinoa, stir once, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, over medium heat for 12 minutes. Strain and rinse well with cold water, shaking the sieve well to remove all moisture. When dry, transfer the quinoa to a large bowl. Add the cucumbers, onion, tomato, parsley, mint, olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, salt, and pepper and toss well. Spoon onto endive spears, top with avocado, and serve."
